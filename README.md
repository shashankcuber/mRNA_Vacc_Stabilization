# mRNA Vaccine Degradation Prediction and finding stable RNA secondary structure
Dataset : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QrWTHn2ykLCfl6BapbO7BWvMi1soxlnJ?usp=share_link 

Steps to run:
 1. Copy the Dataset to your own drive.
 2. For getting wandb key of yours follow this -> https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart
 3. If you don't want to train don't run the Training bi-GRU section you can load the trained model from bi-gru.pt(Follow Inference section code for more details) 
 4. Everything is setup just run the mRNA_vaccine_stabilizer.ipynb on google colab
